					dt notes <dd> A lead introduces the pice, imitated by others. Two voices seem to combat each other, fighting for first place, while still not overcoming the lead. All the voices join in harmony on the same chord at the end of each verse. A pause between each verse both allows the singers to recover from sustaining such a long chors and allows the congregation to focus attention on the upcomming verse.

					dt notes <dd> This soft piece was sung by a lead male with a lute accompaniment. The lute was so quiet, it was almost unnoticeable at times -- though it did have a moment where it was almost polyphonic. The piece used two-note stepwise intervals and a paired meter to sound like a human crying. The song was primarily in the minor key, but verse B began in a major key. While it's possible this was done to break up the piece, it's interesting that just as a low-high-low note sounds like a human sobbing, a minor-major-minor verse progression could have the same effect. The John Downland seems to really like pairs in this song. Just as notes are paired, the verses are also repeated, AA, BB, CC. This piece would have been performed as an act, or a part of a show. Perhaps as chamber music. This piece was written in the Renaissance period, and reflects the hiehgtened sense of dismay that was prevalent in the culture at the time.
