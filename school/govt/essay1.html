            Military draft should include all eligible persons.
            (Roemer, 111)
          </p>
          <p>
            Women will inevitably be drafted.
            There are certain things that will most certainly happen, and other things that will most likely never happen. Americans will almost definitely see another war in the future. Whether we had a place in it, or another country started it. On the 'never' side of things, we'll likely never see inter-galactic Star-Trek style communication. Another thing in the most-likely category is the inevitable reality that women will be entered into military draft. The ever-decreasing value on human life, the increasing blurring of the lines between all distinctions of humans, and the slowly increasing demand on American men as soldiers are all building up to the perfect storm. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Women don't receive equal protection if they can't pick a branch.
            The aspect of Selective Service that women should be entitled to is the ability to choose which branch in the event of draft.
          </p>
          <p>
            Women weren't allowed in combat.
            (Rhode, 98)
          </p>
          <p>
            Women have been given due process.
            (Rostker v. Goldberg)
          </p>
          <p>
            Combat Exclusion Rule rescinded.
            (Kennedy, 280)
            In January 2013, the Department of Defense officially rescinded the direct combat exclusion in place since 1994. This will potentially open all or almost all positions to women. The services are to submit implementation plans by May 15, 2013
          </p>
          <p>
            A bullet does not discriminate.
            "We find that the 'difference in gender' aggravator is legitimately based upon realistic physiological size and strength differences of men and women such that it does not violate equal protection" 
            (State v. Wright, 315)
          </p>
          <p>
            Physical fitness testing should be job specific.
            (Simon, 179)
          </p>
          <p>
            Women served as men in the Civil War.
            (Coughlin, 440)
            Women did not serve openly during the Civil War, but disguised themselves as men only to be buried in unmarked graves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Triumph over discrimination is not a sudden process. 
            (Lively, 110)
            "The triumph of Harlen's dissenting views was a protracted rather than sudden process"
