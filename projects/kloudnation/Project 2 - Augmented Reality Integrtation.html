                KloudNation is currently developing an iPhone and Android App. Currently the iPhone app is functional 
                and has a UI. 
                The iPhone app needs an Augmented Reality screen added to the already existing code base.
                When attempting to add an Augmented Reality screen, the project ceased to compile, and KloudNation 
                would like assistance resolving this issue.

                      <ul>
                        <li>Resolve current compilation issues</li>
                        <li>Integrate Augmented Reality into the project</li>

                    <h3>Constraint Prioritization</h3>
                    <p>
                      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                        <dt>Schedule</dt>
                        <dd>
                          Schedule is of the utmost importance. Project must meet customer expectations in regards 
                          to schedule.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Scope</dt>
                        <dd>
                          Scope is somewhat flexible. Scope may be adjusted if necessary in order to
                          meet the schedule constraint, but should be as close to the original plan 
                          as possible.

                        <dt>Budget</dt>
                        <dd>
                          Budget is the most flexible. Adjusting budget will be the 
                          primary method to adapting to project changes in order to meet 
                          schedule and scope constraints

                      <ul>
                        <li>Resolve current compilation issues by adjusting settings or removing componentes that will no compile</li>
                        <li>Integrate the <q>Vuforia</q> framework into the existing project. If not possible, then substitute an Augmented Reality framework that will compile into the project</li>

                        <li>Make the Augmented Reality screen download data from the KloudNation server in order to get Tracking images and movies that will play when those tracking images are "seen" by the phone.</li>
                        <li>Make the phone auto-play the videos when in view</li>
                        <li>Change the beacon system to send beacon updates every time anything changes about the top three beacons</li>
                        <li>Change the beacon system to weed out irregular beacon data</li>

            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>This project has a poorly defined scope. As such, the expectations are subject to change throughout. The potential impact of this risk is that the project could drastically increase in scope, and, therefore, schedule.
                  <p><b>Remediation:</b><i> Establish a tighter scope, or set a budget limit to prevent scope creep.</i></p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Assumptions</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>The UI is in a functional state.</li>
                <li>The environment in which the Augmented Reality will be utilized has been determined.</li>
                <li>The radio beacons have been aquired by KloudNation and will not change at the time of using the application.</li>
                <li>There are a finite number of targets, which have been determined by KloudNation.</li>
                <li>The web server for delivering the Augmented Reality content is in a stable state.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>
                    <h3>Process to Monitor Progress</h3>
                    <p>
                      <p>As KloudNation is expecting all work to be delivered within 24 hours of beginning work, there will be no process to monitor progress and KloudNation will review the application after it is considered by Samuel Dillow to be completed.</p>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Change Control Procedure</h3>
                    <p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>If changes to the project are deemed necessary, Samuel Dillow will review them with KloudNation and determine whether or not the changes may be completed without additional impact to the project constraints. If an impact is found, the Project Definition may be updated and re-approved. A written consent of the changes (email or otherwise) may be accepted in lieu of an updated Project Definition.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Acceptance of Deliverables</h3>
                    <p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>KloudNation will provide a software developer to review and verify the code or information produced.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
            </p>
            <h2>Equipment and Facility Needs</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Samuel Dillow will require access to the customer facility. Access hours may be negotiated either during KloudNation work schedule for convenience, or outside KloudNation work schedule to prevent potential services interruption.</li>
                <li>Samuel Dillow will require a working phone with which to test the software.</li>
                <li>Samuel Dillow will require access to and control of no less than three of the beacons that will be used during the event.</li>
                <li>For th epurposes of testing, Samuel Dillow will require the same access to the server that will be granted to the application, and by extension, KloudNation customers during the event.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Project Completion Criteria</h2>
            <p>
              <p>
                The project will be considered complete when project deliverables listed in the <q>Deliverables</q> section have been 
                completed.
              </p>
