    `His degree in Electrical Engineering will be critical for establishing a
    stable charging environment and dealing with communication between the
    Charge Point and the actual charging hardware.`,
    `For fun, he developed a backup sensor for a real-world vehicle during his
    time at the University of Texas at Dallas. The motion sensor was written for
    the Texas Instruments MSP 430 and utilized an onboard wireless antenna to
    communicate with the rest of the instrumentation of the vehicle.`,
    `Chris was in the Math club of the University of Texas at Dallas. His
    ability to crunch numbers in his head while working is extremely helpful

        `Software Engineer ­ Developer on the Platform team from which the core
        technology stemmed in the company.`,
        `New Front End UI ­ Developed and integrated visual enhancements for the
        main UI of the technology. Worked with the in house designer to
        implement the desired look and feel of the application while providing
        suggestions for further enhancements.`,
        `3D Framework ­ Scoped and worked on implementing a 3D framework to
        model the company’s data model for representing a Supply Chain. This
        included writing a working system for Flash + Away3D at first, then
        reformatting to the suggested platform of Unity. This interface includes
        2D and 3D elements with interactive components that a user can
        manipulate to seamlessly interact with the backend data. This seamless
        interaction worked via a complicated bridging system between plugin and
        browser javascript which communicated to a Java server backend for
        persistence.`,
        `Design Patterns (New Framework RnD) ­ Encouraged and worked with
        co­workers to develop a new methodology of implementing new UIs by
        introducing design patterns to the legacy system. This has led to the
        exploration and implementation of new features in an MVP and FLUX
        pattern while testing and trying modern frameworks such as React,
        Requirejs, Underscore, and many others to find the ideal pipeline. We
        used our research to integrate older legacy implementations to the newer
        patterns.`,
        `Build Processes and new Javascript Standards ­ Engineered and
        integrated build processes to include a workflow for utilizing new Web
        standards such as ES6 and module support. This had many technical
        requirements to work with legacy systems and support a crossover of CMD
        and AMD module loading to allow for partial bundling of the Client’s SPA
        code base. This also included integrating ReactJS with the system and
        support injecting other third party libraries into the company’s
        workflow.`,
