    `The main thing people ask me is what language do you program in. Strange
    question, as most good programmers can program in nearly any language. I
    started programming when I was 8, so I have racked up experience in over
    40 languages to this point.`,
    `In the United States Air Force I learned about leadership and the
    importance of structure. Combining my passion for programming and the
    experience of the US Military I have led several teams in the development
    and delivery of disparate software solutions.`,
    'However, my favorite languages are C++, NodeJS, and Java.',
  ],
  favorites: {
    'C++':
      `I use C++ when I write command line utilities that need to do things
      that regular scripts cannot. I write about 6 command line programs per
      year.`,
    'NodeJS':
      `Since V8 has revamped the JavaScript world, I've been writing
      applications in JavaScript. I find it to be tons faster and more stable.
      Now that NodeJS has a CLR, it's an excellent platform to write fast and
      responsive cross-platform code. I've written server apps with it, and
      used Electron (and nw.js) to write GUI apps.`,
    'Java':
      `Java has a lot of trouble doing operating system specific tasks, so
      it's great for writing a cross-platform application. I use Java for
      command line utilities and web servers. I write about 1 Java program per
      month.`,
    'TCL':
      `I use TCL / Expect to write anything that has to be done with CLI, but
      takes up more than one line. Bash / Zsh scripts usually can do the
      trick, but many times TCL ends up creating a much more intelligent
      product. I write about 1 TCL script per week.`
