      40 languages to this point.`,

        `Since V8 has revamped the JavaScript world, I've been writing
        applications in JavaScript. I find it to be tons faster and more stable.
        Now that NodeJS has a CLR, it's an excellent platform to write fast and
        responsive cross-platform code. I've written server apps with it, and
        used Electron (and nw.js) to write GUI apps.`,
      'Java':
        `Java has a lot of trouble doing operating system specific tasks, so
        it's great for writing a cross-platform application. I use Java for
        command line utilities and web servers. I write about 1 Java program per
        month.`,
      'TCL':
        `I use TCL / Expect to write anything that has to be done with CLI, but
        takes up more than one line. Bash / Zsh scripts usually can do the
        trick, but many times TCL ends up creating a much more intelligent
        product. I write about 1 TCL script per week.`
